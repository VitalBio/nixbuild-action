inputs:

  nixbuild_ssh_key:
    required: false
    default: ''
    description: |
      The private SSH key used to authenticate with nixbuild.net. An alternative
      to SSH key authentication is to use token-based authentication by
      configuring the nixbuild_token setting. If a token is configured you can
      leave nixbuild_ssh_key unset, but one of the settings must be set in
      order for authentication to work.

      You should not add your private key directly to the workflow file but
      instead define a GitHub Secret for it, to avoid mistakenly sharing your
      key with others.

      It is advisable to create a new nixbuild.net SSH key specifically for
      use within GitHub (or even per repository or workflow). That way you can
      revoke access to your nixbuild.net account in a fine-grained fashion.

      See the README of this action for easy setup instructions.

  nixbuild_token:
    required: false
    default: ''
    description: |
      The private Biscuit token used to authenticate with nixbuild.net. If you
      use SSH key authentication (by configuring nixbuild_ssh_key) this setting
      can be unset, but one of the settings must be set in order for
      authentication to work.

      The token must at least have the permissions 'build:read', 'build:write',
      'store:read', 'store:write' and 'account:read'.

      You should not add your private token directly to the workflow file but
      instead define a GitHub Secret for it, to avoid mistakenly sharing your
      token with others.


  generate_summary_for:
    required: false
    default: ''
    description: |
      If set to 'job', a summary of all builds and their resource usage will be
      generated as a GitHub Actions step summary for the job that used
      nixbuild-action.

      If set to 'workflow', the summary will instead include builds from all
      jobs executed so far during the workflow run. A workflow summary makes
      most sense for the very last job in your workflow (since it can be
      incomplete otherwise).

      If set to '', no summary will be generated.


  caches:
    required: false
    description: |
      Set the caches setting in nixbuild.net. For documentation
      see https://docs.nixbuild.net/settings/#caches.
      Separate multiple caches with a comma.
      You must have corresponding access tokens setup in your account on
      nixbuild.net, see https://docs.nixbuild.net/settings/#access-tokens.

  reuse-build-failures:
    required: false
    description: |
      Set the reuse-build-failures setting in nixbuild.net. For documentation
      see https://docs.nixbuild.net/settings/#reuse-build-failures.

  reuse-build-timeouts:
    required: false
    description: |
      Set the reuse-build-timeouts setting in nixbuild.net. For documentation
      see https://docs.nixbuild.net/settings/#reuse-build-timeouts.

  keep-builds-running:
    required: false
    description: |
      Set the keep-builds-running setting in nixbuild.net. For documentation
      see https://docs.nixbuild.net/settings/#keep-builds-running.
